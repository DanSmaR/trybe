Zimbabwe He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.
He was 100% into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn't eat.
He waited for the stop sign to turn to a go sign.
He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.
The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.
She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.
Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.
I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.
